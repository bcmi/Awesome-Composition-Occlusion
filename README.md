A curated list of resources including papers, datasets, and relevant links pertaining to occlusion issue for image composition, which aims to address the occlusion between inserted foreground object and background objects in a composite image. For more complete resources on general 
image composition ([object insertion](https://github.com/bcmi/Awesome-Object-Insertion)), please refer to [Awesome-Image-Composition](https://github.com/bcmi/Awesome-Object-Insertion).
